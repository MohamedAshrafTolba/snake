# Snake
A command line based snake game :snake:.

### Prerequisites
For [Microsoft Windows versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Windows_versions) prior to [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10) where [Win32 console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32_console) doesn't recognize the [ANSI escape code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).
One solution is to install [ANSICON](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon) which processes ANSI escape sequences 
for Windows console programs before running the game's executable file. For further information
please refer to this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16755142/how-to-make-win32-console-recognize-ansi-vt100-escape-sequences) thread.
